Under OpenClaw, background it through the `exec` tool:

- Pass `background: true` and `timeout: 0` (no kill timer). Never rely on the auto-yield or a finite timeout.
- Set the exec `workdir` to the project root as an **absolute** path (`~` is not expanded there), or `cd` into the project inside the command itself.
