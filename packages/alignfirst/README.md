# alignfirst

The AlignFirst CLI provides collaborative software-development workflows, work files, and documentation discovery. Work files are organized by ticket and kept either git-ignored in the project or synchronized through a work-files repository.

## Agent skills

Nine Agent Skill stubs expose the CLI as commands in Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. Install them globally:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --global \
  --skill al --skill alplan --skill alspec --skill aldescription \
  --skill alreview --skill alcatchup --skill almerge \
  --skill alcatchupaad --skill alcatchupspec
```

Install the `alignfirst` skill when a project's `AGENTS.md` does not run `npx alignfirst context`; it lets the agent recognize a protocol named in prose:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --global --skill alignfirst
```

The skills run the CLI through `npx`, so installing it is optional.

### Update the agent skills

```sh
npx skills update --global
```

## Workflows

These examples use the `/` form. Replace it with `$` in Codex.

| Workflow | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specification | `/alspec <request>` | Discuss and write a technical specification. |
| Planning | `/alplan` | Turn a specification into one or more implementation plans. |
| Align and do | `/al <request>` | Discuss and implement a small change, then write a summary. |
| Description | `/aldescription` | Summarize the work and propose a commit message. |
| Review | `/alreview` | Review the current branch against its base. |
| Merge | `/almerge` | Resolve merge or rebase conflicts. |
| Catch up | `/alcatchup` | Load the current ticket history and continue. |
| Catch up and AAD | `/alcatchupaad <request>` | Load ticket history, then start AAD. |
| Catch up and spec | `/alcatchupspec <request>` | Load ticket history, then start specification. |

To implement a plan, start a fresh agent context and ask it to execute the plan file.

AlignFirst stores the work files of a ticket, such as specifications, plans and summaries, in `.plans/<ticket-id>/`. It normally derives the ticket ID from the request or branch and asks when none is available. Files use a cycle letter and sequence number, such as `A1-spec.md` and `A2-plan.md`.

## Global CLI

To type `alignfirst` instead of `npx alignfirst`, install the CLI globally:

```sh
npm install -g alignfirst
```

### Update the global CLI

```sh
npm update -g alignfirst
```

## Set up a project (with your agent)

Temporarily install the setup-guide skill:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --skill alignfirst-setup-guide
```

Then ask your agent:

```text
Use your alignfirst-setup-guide skill. What AlignFirst tooling could we add in this project?
```

The guide installs the selected components and configures the repository. You can remove the setup-guide skill once setup is complete.

## CLI commands

- `guide` — Print an AlignFirst protocol.
- `ticket` — Resolve a ticket directory, load its history, or get its next file.
- `sync` — Synchronize the work files with the work-files repository.
- `plans` — Link `.plans` to the work-files repository, check the link, archive tickets.
- `docmap` — Browse project documentation.
- `conventions` — Print the effective project conventions.
- `context` — Print the conventions, the documentation map when `docs/` exists, and the protocol aliases.
- `config` — Report the effective project configuration.
- `doctor` — Diagnose an AlignFirst setup.

Run `alignfirst --help` for command usage or `alignfirst guide` to choose a protocol. `alignfirst guide <protocol>` prints the selected protocol followed by the ticket directory and work file rules. Add `--protocol-only` when those rules are already in context.

### Catchup output

`alignfirst ticket [<id>] --catchup` prints the ticket's Markdown files, plans excluded.

## Upgrade from v1, v2, or v3

Install the setup-guide skill and ask your agent to run its upgrade route:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/paleo/alignfirst --skill alignfirst-setup-guide
```

```text
Use your alignfirst-setup-guide skill. Upgrade AlignFirst in this project.
```

You can remove the setup-guide skill once the upgrade is complete.
